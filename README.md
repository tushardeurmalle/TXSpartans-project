Bharat Pashudhan — AI Breed Identification

Problem India has 50+ cattle and buffalo breeds, but misidentification is common due to local naming variations, calf vs adult differences, cross-breed confusion, and limited training. This leads to wrong data, subsidy fraud, poor breed improvement planning, and farmer income loss.


✅ Solution An AI-powered system (mobile + web) that identifies breeds using images, biometrics, audio, and GPS. It works offline-first, supports farmer-in-the-loop validation, and stores secure, tamper-proof records on blockchain. Certificates and advisories are generated for farmers and vets. 💼 Business Model The system is designed to be scalable, reliable, impactful, and profitable: • Government contracts for cattle census, subsidy verification, and livestock schemes. • SaaS model for veterinary departments, insurance companies, and cooperatives. • Farmer subscription for premium features like advisory, growth prediction, and health alerts. • Data monetization for research institutes, agri-tech companies, and policy makers. • Partnerships with dairy cooperatives, NGOs, and state departments for mass adoption.

🏗️ Architecture
Mobile App → Capture photos, biometrics, GPS, offline-first inference.

Backend → APIs, ML inference, data storage.

Blockchain → Tamper-proof animal records & certificates.

Monitoring → Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry for reliability.
